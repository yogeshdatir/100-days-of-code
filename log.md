### Day 0: April 18, 2021
##### (the new Django-React E-commerce platform project)

**Today's Progress**: Created Navbar and Sign In Page for for the app. Integrated Django allauth, rest-framework. 

**Tasks to be completed**: 
1. Create Registration feature design.
2. Will be creating and testing login, register APIs this week.

**Thoughts:** I am focusing on UI with React, I want to improve Translating designs and wireframes into high-quality code.I really struggle with some complex css design part. But I think only way to get better at it is creating UI designs as many as possible regularly.
